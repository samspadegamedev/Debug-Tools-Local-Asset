GENERAL OVERVIEW

A small set of custom scripts which make it a little easier to print out debug_messages in the 
output window. 


HOW TO ADD TO YOUR PROJECT

Simple add the debug utility folder to your project either using the my library tab marketplace,
or turn it into a local asset and add it that way.


USE

Can be used exactly the same way show_debug_messages are used.
